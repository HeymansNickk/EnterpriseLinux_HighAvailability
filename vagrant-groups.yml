# Ansible group definitions
#
# This should be a dictionary with group names as keys and a list of hosts that
# are members of the group as values. E.g.
#
#db:
#  - db

lb:
  - lb

web:
  - web1
#  - web2
#  - web3
#  - web4
#  - web5
#  - web6
#
# Leave the file empty if you do not want to define groups.
